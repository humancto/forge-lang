# Changelog

All notable changes to Forge will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`forge test --coverage`** — line coverage reporting for Forge test files. Tracks executed lines during test runs and displays per-file and overall coverage percentages with color-coded output (green ≥80%, yellow ≥50%, red <50%).

- **`forge publish`** — package and publish Forge projects to the local filesystem registry (`~/.forge/registry/<name>/<version>/`). Supports `--dry-run` to preview without publishing and `--registry` to specify a custom registry path. Validates manifest fields, computes SHA-256 checksums, and excludes non-source files (forge_modules, .git, tests, etc.).
- **VM as default engine** — the bytecode VM is now the default execution engine for `forge run`. The interpreter is available via `--interp` flag. Programs using decorator-driven HTTP servers (`@server`, `@get`, etc.) automatically fall back to the interpreter.
- **VM `must` expression** — `must Ok(42)` unwraps to `42`, `must Err("x")` crashes with clear error, `must null` crashes. Full parity with interpreter semantics.
- **VM `ask` expression** — `ask "prompt"` calls the LLM API (OpenAI-compatible) in VM mode. Requires `FORGE_AI_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- **VM `freeze` expression** — `freeze expr` wraps values as immutable in VM mode. `SetField` on frozen values returns a runtime error.
- **Cross-file LSP** — go-to-definition and find-references now work across files. Imported symbols resolve to their source file via `import` statement following. Find-references searches imported files and sibling `.fg` files in the same directory. Import statements now appear in document symbols.
- **`forge build --aot`** — compiles Forge source to bytecode and embeds it in a native binary. Unlike `--native` (which embeds raw source), `--aot` embeds serialized bytecode for faster startup and no source exposure. The binary still requires the Forge VM runtime at execution time.
- **`forge dap` — Debug Adapter Protocol server** for VS Code step-through debugging. Supports breakpoints, step over/in/out, continue, pause, variable inspection, and call stack traces. The interpreter pauses at breakpoints via shared debug state with timeout-based cooperative waiting. Output from `print`/`say`/`yell`/`whisper` is captured and sent as DAP output events to prevent stdout corruption.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **LSP `textDocument/references`** — find all references to any identifier in the current document with word-boundary matching
- **LSP hover for user-defined symbols** — functions show full signature, variables show mutability/type, structs show fields, types show variants, interfaces show methods
- **LSP deep go-to-definition** — finds function parameters, local variables, for-loop vars, catch vars, and impl block methods — not just top-level symbols
- **LSP context-aware module completions** — typing `math.` now only shows `math` module members instead of all 200+ members from every module
- **LSP type-check diagnostics** — the gradual type checker now runs on every edit, surfacing type mismatches, arity errors, and return type mismatches as editor warnings with line numbers
- **REPL syntax highlighting** — keywords (magenta), builtins (blue), modules (green), strings (yellow), numbers (cyan), comments (dim)
- **REPL live tab completion** — user-defined variables and functions now appear in tab completion alongside builtins
- **REPL `env` command** — now shows all defined variables and their values instead of just `_last`
- **`forge doc` variable extraction** — `let`/`let mut` declarations now appear in doc output (previously silently skipped)
- **`forge doc` comment extraction** — `//` comments preceding functions, structs, and variables are now captured and displayed
- **`forge fmt` paren continuation** — multi-line function calls with open parens now auto-indent correctly (previously only braces and brackets were tracked)
- **`forge run` with manifest entry** — `forge run` without a file argument now reads the `entry` field from `forge.toml`, enabling project-level `forge run` workflows
- **Relative import resolution** — `import "helper"` now resolves relative to the importing file's directory first, then falls back to CWD and `forge_modules/`. Enables packages with internal imports.
- **Import struct/type/impl definitions** — wildcard imports (`import "lib"`) now copy struct definitions, type definitions, and impl block methods in addition to functions and variables
- **Source spans in AST** — all inner statement bodies (`if`, `for`, `while`, `fn`, `match`, `try/catch`, etc.) now carry per-statement line and column info via `SpannedStmt`. Runtime errors report the exact source line, even inside deeply nested blocks.
- **VM stdlib parity: 47 new builtins** — added 4 missing module namespaces (`npc`, `url`, `toml`, `ws`) and 43 standalone builtins to the VM: collections (`first`, `last`, `zip`, `flatten`, `chunk`, `slice`, `compact`, `partition`, `group_by`, `sort_by`, `for_each`, `take_n`, `skip`, `frequencies`, `sample`, `shuffle`), strings (`typeof`, `substring`, `index_of`, `last_index_of`, `capitalize`, `title`, `upper`, `lower`, `trim`, `pad_start`, `pad_end`, `repeat_str`, `count`, `slugify`, `snake_case`, `camel_case`), GenZ debug kit, and execution helpers
- **Line-accurate runtime errors** — errors inside nested blocks now show the correct inner line with source snippets via ariadne, instead of pointing at the top-level statement
- **JIT: logical And/Or** — `&&`/`||` in JIT-compiled functions now use logical semantics (result is 0 or 1) instead of bitwise AND/OR which produced wrong results for non-boolean integers (e.g. `2 && 3` was `2`, now correctly `1`)
- **JIT: support up to 8 function arguments** — JIT dispatch previously silently dropped arguments beyond 3; now supports 0–8 arguments for both integer and float functions
- **VM async: spawn/await** — `spawn { }` now runs on a real OS thread in `--vm` mode (previously ran synchronously inline). `await` blocks on the spawned task's result via `Condvar`. Cross-thread value transfer uses `SharedValue` enum to avoid GC reference leaks. Supports nested spawn, variable capture via upvalues, string/object/array return values, and error isolation. 12 new tests.
- **JIT: 24 new tests** — comprehensive coverage for logical operators, multi-argument functions, float arithmetic, recursive algorithms, and comparison operators
- **VM: schedule/watch blocks** — `schedule every N seconds/minutes/hours { }` and `watch "path" { }` now work in `--vm` mode. Both compile to dedicated opcodes and spawn background threads using the same `fork_for_spawn` + `SendableVM` infrastructure from spawn/await. Includes interval validation and upvalue capture. 9 new tests.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **`db.begin` / `db.commit` / `db.rollback`** — explicit transaction control for the SQLite module, sharing the existing thread-local connection.
- **`pg.begin` / `pg.commit` / `pg.rollback`** — same trio for the PostgreSQL module, backed by `client.batch_execute`.
- **Opt-in filesystem confinement** — setting `FORGE_FS_BASE=/path` confines every `fs.*` operation that touches a path to that subtree (with symlink resolution). Pure path manipulation helpers (`dirname`, `basename`, `ext`, `join_path`, `temp_dir`) are exempt; `exists`/`is_dir`/`is_file` return `false` instead of erroring on confinement failure so script branches still work.
- **VM source-line stack traces** — `VMError` now carries real `(function, line)` frames populated from the bytecode line table, and the CLI prints them via the `Display` impl rather than dropping them on the floor. Makes `--vm` errors actionable.
- **69 new unit tests** for `crypto`, `regex`, `json`, and `time` stdlib modules — these had **zero** prior coverage despite living on the security-critical / format-correctness paths. Includes RFC 4231 HMAC-SHA256 vector, century-rule leap year cases, and JSON deep-merge round trip.
- **`PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`** — internal punch list tracking all v0.4.3+ hardening work.

### Fixed

- **`http.get/post/...` had no redirect limit** — could be steered around localhost guards with a 302 chain. Now capped at **5 redirects** (down from reqwest's default of 10) via a custom `redirect::Policy` that re-validates every hop's URL through the same scheme + private-address checks the initial URL went through. Open-redirect → `file://`, `ftp://`, or an internal host gets rejected at the policy callback.
- **`http.download` / `http.crawl` had no body-size cap** — single response could OOM the host. Added a streaming size cap that fast-fails on advertised `Content-Length` _and_ enforces during read.
- **HTTP SSRF / scheme bypasses** — every HTTP entrypoint now rejects non-`http(s)` schemes and (when `FORGE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE=1` is set) refuses RFC1918 / loopback / link-local / ULA / multicast destinations. The guard is **opt-in** via env var because allowing localhost is the right default for dev tooling; production deployments should set `FORGE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE=1`. `http.download` and `http.crawl` go through the same validator, not just `http.get`/`post`.
- **HTTP DNS-rebinding window on the initial connection** — Forge resolves the host itself, validates the address, then pins it into reqwest via `Client::builder().resolve(host, addr)` so the TCP connect uses the exact address that passed the check. Closes the TOCTOU window between Forge's DNS check and reqwest's own connect-time lookup. Note: this protection is **only for the initial URL** — redirected hops are re-validated via DNS (closing the open-redirect class) but not pinned, so a microsecond-scale rebind window remains on redirect targets. Treat untrusted redirect chains as untrusted.
- **HTTP IPv4-mapped IPv6 bypass** — `ip_is_private` previously matched only on the IPv6 segment pattern, so `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` slipped past the loopback guard. Now mapped addresses are unwrapped and classified against the inner IPv4. Test fixtures cover `::ffff:{127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254}`.
- **`jwt.verify` accepted `alg: none` tokens** — header parser now rejects `none` (and case variants) before any signature verification path runs.
- **`jwt.verify` key-confusion vulnerability** — an attacker could sign a token with HS256 using an RSA public key as the HMAC secret, and `jwt.verify` would accept it because it trusted whatever algorithm the token header claimed. `jwt.verify` now accepts an optional third argument `{ algorithm: "RS256" }` that pins the expected algorithm; if the token header claims a different algorithm, verification fails with a clear mismatch error.
- **`pg.connect` defaulted to plaintext** — now defaults to TLS with full server certificate verification using webpki roots. Plaintext requires an explicit `"disable"` (or `"none"`/`"no-tls"`/`"plain"`) mode argument. `"tls-no-verify"` opts out of cert verification for dev.
- **`pg.query` / `pg.execute` raw-pointer client extraction** — replaced with a clean `Arc::clone` checkout from the thread-local `RefCell`, eliminating the `unsafe` block and its lifetime hazards. Functionally equivalent under load tests.
- **VM silently dropped `must` / `ask` / `await` / `freeze` / `spawn` expressions** — the compiler stripped them and ran the inner expression with no error. Now `--vm` rejects programs containing these constructs up front with a specific message naming the unsupported feature.
- **LSP returned malformed responses for unknown methods** — now responds with proper `MethodNotFound` error per LSP spec.
- **Two production-path `unwrap()` calls** — `jwt.sign` re-fetched a matched argument via `args.first().unwrap()` (replaced with `Some(v @ Value::Object(_))` binding); `crypto::rand_byte` could panic on a pre-1970 system clock (replaced with `unwrap_or(0)`). Every other `unwrap()` in the tree (309 total) is now confirmed to live in `#[cfg(test)]` modules.

### Security

- HTTP SSRF/scheme/redirect/size hardening (see Fixed).
- JWT `alg=none` rejection (see Fixed).
- JWT key-confusion defence via algorithm pinning (see Fixed).
- PostgreSQL TLS-by-default (see Fixed).
- Filesystem `FORGE_FS_BASE` confinement (see Added).

### Changed

- **`http.download` / `http.crawl` now accept an options object** — `timeout`, `max_redirects`, `max_bytes` can be passed via `http.download(url, dest, { timeout: 60, max_bytes: 10000000 })` and `http.crawl(url, { timeout: 10 })`. Previously these functions used hardcoded defaults and ignored user options.
- `--vm` and `--jit` CLI help text rewritten to spell out exact limitations: VM rejects `ask`/`await`/`must`/`freeze`/`spawn` and decorator-driven runtime features; JIT supports only the integer-loop subset and falls back to the bytecode VM for everything else.
- `mysql.begin`/`commit`/`rollback` are intentionally **not** added — `mysql_async`'s pool returns a fresh physical connection on every `get_conn()`, so transaction control across separate calls would silently target different connections. A note in `mysql::create_module` documents the limitation.

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **VM `is_some()` / `is_none()` were stubs that always returned `false`** — restored real ADT-aware logic for `Option<T>` values in `--vm` mode
- **VM `keys({})` returned an error on empty objects** — now correctly returns `[]` matching interpreter behaviour
- **VM `split(str, "")` did not split into characters** — empty delimiter now produces a char array (parity with interpreter)
- **VM `int(bool)` raised an error** — `true` → `1`, `false` → `0` now works in `--vm` mode
- **VM `sort()` only handled Int/Float** — String comparison and custom comparator function now supported
- **VM `ok()`/`err()` lowercase aliases silently fell through** — `"Ok" | "Some"` match arm appeared before `"ok"` alias, making lowercase calls return `unknown builtin`; arm order corrected
- **VM `float()` did not accept strings** — `float("3.14")` now parses correctly (parity with interpreter)
- **VM `entries({})` returned `Null` for empty object** — now returns `[]` (parity fix)
- **VM `find` / `flat_map` spawned a full Interpreter instance per call** — replaced with native VM loop implementations; no more per-call interpreter startup cost
- **VM missing builtins: `any`, `all`, `unique`, `sum`, `min_of`, `max_of`, `assert_ne`** — implemented natively in `vm/builtins.rs` AND registered in `vm/machine.rs` builtin registry (registration was the critical missing step — without it names resolved as `undefined variable`)
- **`pg.query` / `pg.execute` nested `block_on` deadlock** — the previous pattern `block_in_place(|| handle.block_on(async { rt.block_on(client.query) }))` is undefined/deadlock in Tokio; fixed by extracting a raw pointer to the client before `block_in_place`, then awaiting the query directly in the outer async block
- **`sus()` panic on no arguments** — `args.into_iter().next().unwrap()` → `unwrap_or(Value::Null)`
- **Parser `decorators.pop().unwrap()`** — replaced with `ok_or_else(ParseError)` to avoid panic on unexpected empty decorator list
- **8× `Mutex::lock().unwrap()` in interpreter `Environment`** — replaced with poison-recovery `lock().unwrap_or_else(|p| p.into_inner())` to prevent panic propagation if a spawned thread panics while holding the lock
- **Bare `unwrap()` in interpreter method dispatch path** (`mod.rs:1797`) — replaced with `unwrap_or(Value::Null)` to prevent panic on edge-case object mutation
- **Unsafe `unwrap()` in VM GetField handler** (`machine.rs:852`) — replaced with `expect("BUG: ...")` for better crash diagnostics
- **Compiler `loops.pop().unwrap()`** in While/Loop/For compile paths — replaced with `ok_or_else(CompileError)` to avoid panic on malformed AST

### Changed

- JIT `runtime.rs`: added `#![allow(dead_code)]` with explanatory comment — all unused functions are M2 NaN-boxing bridge infrastructure, intentionally kept ready

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- **Closure mutable capture (BUG-005)** — mutable variables captured in closures now persist mutations across invocations instead of resetting to the initial value
- **Unwrap safety sweep** — removed all bare `unwrap()` calls from production execution paths in `interpreter/builtins.rs` and `interpreter/call_builtin.rs`
- **LSP incremental sync** — fixed `textDocument/didChange` handler dropping partial edits in large files
- **REPL multi-line paste** — pasted blocks with embedded newlines no longer trigger premature evaluation

### Changed

- Extracted `call_builtin` and `call_native` into separate files (`interpreter/call_builtin.rs`, `vm/builtins.rs`) for readability — zero behaviour change
- Version bump: `0.4.1` → `0.4.2`

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **`mysql` module** — `mysql.connect`, `mysql.query`, `mysql.execute`, `mysql.close` with parameterised queries and connection pooling (mirrors `pg` API)
- **`jwt` module** — `jwt.sign`, `jwt.verify`, `jwt.decode`, `jwt.valid` supporting HS256/384/512, RS256, ES256
- **`time` module** — `time.now`, `time.unix`, `time.format`, `time.parse`, `time.diff`, `time.sleep`
- **`csv` improvements** — `csv.read` / `csv.write` now handle quoted fields with embedded commas and newlines

### Fixed

- `http.post` with JSON body set incorrect `Content-Type` (was `text/plain`, now `application/json`)
- `fs.read_json` panicked on malformed JSON instead of returning `Err`
- `pg.connect` TLS mode `"tls-no-verify"` was not recognised (case sensitivity)

### Changed

- Version bump: `0.4.0` → `0.4.1`

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- **Bytecode VM** (`--vm` flag) — register-based virtual machine with own compiler, GC, and JIT integration
- **JIT compilation** (`--jit` flag) — Cranelift-backed JIT for numeric hot loops; auto-promotes functions after 100 calls
- **VM serialisation** — compiled bytecode can be serialised to `.fgc` files and loaded without re-parsing
- **`pg` module (PostgreSQL)** — `pg.connect`, `pg.query`, `pg.execute`, `pg.close` with TLS support (`no-tls`, `tls`, `tls-no-verify`)
- **`forge build`** command — produces serialised `.fgc` bytecode artefact
- **`forge lsp`** command — Language Server Protocol skeleton (hover, diagnostics, completion stubs)
- **Gradual type checker** — `--strict` emits type warnings without failing; type annotations in function signatures
- **ADT / enum types** — `type Shape = Circle(f) | Rect(f, f)` with exhaustive `match`
- **`struct` + `give` blocks** — struct definitions with default fields and impl-style method blocks
- **`safe { }` block** — null-safe execution scope; errors inside produce `null` instead of crashing
- **`timeout N seconds { }` block** — time-limited execution (interpreter mode)
- **`retry N times { }` block** — automatic retry up to N attempts on error
- **`spawn { }` + channels** — cooperative concurrency with Tokio; `channel()`, `send()`, `receive()`
- **30 interactive tutorials** (`forge learn`)

### Changed

- Interpreter is now the _default_ engine; VM/JIT are opt-in
- `println` aliased to `say` (both work)
- Version bump: `0.3.0` → `0.4.0`

---

- `safe` and `when` work as both statements and expressions
- Spread operator properly flattens: `[...a, 4, 5]` → `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Pipeline operator `|>` correctly returns values
